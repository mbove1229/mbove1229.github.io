      <h2>Plumbing System</h2>
      <p>
        The plumbing and water system gives the van running water for cooking, cleaning, and showering.
        It is powered by the electrical system and built to be simple, reliable, and easy to drain and clean
        for winter storage. The setup includes a 25-gallon fresh-water tank, a 12V pump, and a tankless propane
        hot-water shower.
      </p>

        <h3>Fresh-Water Tank</h3>
        <p>
          A 25-gallon tank sits in the rear of the van, positioned near the fill port for easy refilling and draining.
          It’s strapped down securely and vented to prevent pressure buildup.

        <h3>Water Pump</h3>
        <p>
          The 12V Shurflo pump pressurizes the system whenever the sink or shower is turned on.
          It draws from the main tank and pushes water through reinforced ½-inch tubing.

        <h3>Sink & Faucet</h3>
        <p>
          The sink drains to a gray-water line routed underneath the van.
          The faucet runs cold water directly from the pump and can be turned on or off with a single handle.

        <h3>Tankless Hot-Water Shower</h3>
        <p>
          The propane tankless heater provides instant hot water for showering.
          It connects to the same pressurized water line as the sink and mounts on the rear door for outdoor use.
